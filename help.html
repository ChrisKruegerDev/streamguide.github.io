                        Unfortunately, this would cost us a fee of 50,000$/year for Rotten Tomatoes and 48,000$/year for Metacritic, which is clearly too much.

                        TV shows might not be displayed on the progress page. In most cases, Moviebase couldnâ€™t fetch TV shows through the Trakt synchronization.
                        <br/>
                        This reason is that Trakt and Moviebase use different data sources for TV shows. Trakt obtains the data mainly from TVDB, whereas Moviebase gets the content from TMDB. Both platforms could have missing or wrong IDs for a successful mapping.
                        <br/>
                        How you can fix it by yourself is written here.

                        Trakt and Moviebase use different data sources for TV shows, seasons and episodes. Trakt obtains the data mainly from TVDB, whereas Moviebase gets the content from TMDB. Both platforms could have a different grouping of episodes.

                        If only an episode is missing in the app then you can add it on TMDB directly.

                        To combine the content between Trakt and Moviebase it is important that both platforms have the necessary IDs.
                        <br/>
                        First, you should check if the IDs are available on Trakt. To do so, go to your desired movie or series. Under the poster, you can see the available services.
                        <br/>
                        - For movies, TMDB and/or IMDB must be present.
                        <br/>
                        - For series, TMDB and/or TVDB must be present.
                        <br/>
                        If the IDs are missing then Trakt has to update the data. To do this press the button ""Refresh Data"". Contact us if you cannot use this VIP functionality or the IDs are already available.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        In order for Trakt to find the right data, it is recommended to add the missing IDs on the TMDB website as well. To do this, go to your movie or series on the TMDB website and click the ""Edit"" button under the â€žOverview"" tab. Then you can add all missing IDs in the ""External IDs"" section.

                        After the runtime of the episode or movie has passed, the episode or movie will be set watched on your Trakt profile and in Moviebase.

                    Where are my watched movies and episodes from TMDB?

                        Moviebase removes the mark watched function when the user is logged with TMDB, because TMDB doesnâ€™t support watched movies or episodes.
                        <br/>
                        If you want to mark items as watched then you can use the local app account or connect with Trakt.
